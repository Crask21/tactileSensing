	(08/10: DONE)
- Find a solution to the friction of the shadowhand on the gelsights
	(I am going to try alcohol and gloves)
	(08/10: DONE)
- Improve the constant contact probing
- create the first dataset for vclr
	(08/10: gathered Square and Triangle)
- prepare vclr for the gelsight / shadowhand 
- Consider threading to increase the framerate above 10Hz
